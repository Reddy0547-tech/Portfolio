            <h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
            <p>HTML is the backbone of web development, providing the structure and content of a webpage. It uses a system of elements, defined by tags like div, p, and img, to organize text, images, links, and other media. HTML is not a programming language but a markup language, meaning it describes the content rather than controlling logic or behavior. With modern versions like HTML5, additional features such as semantic elements, audio, video, and APIs have made HTML more powerful and dynamic for web applications.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
            <p>CSS is used to style and format HTML elements, defining how they appear on a webpage. It controls aspects like color, font, spacing, and layout using properties and selectors. CSS can be written inline, internally within a style tag, or externally in a .css file. Advanced CSS techniques include Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts, animations, and media queries for mobile-friendly design. With pre-processors like SASS and frameworks like Tailwind CSS, styling has become more efficient and customizable for developers.</p>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. With an extensive library ecosystem, Python is widely used in web development (Django, Flask), data science (NumPy, pandas), artificial intelligence (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and automation. Its ease of learning and versatility make it one of the most popular languages for beginners and professionals alike.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language known for its “write once, run anywhere” capability, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is widely used in enterprise applications, Android development, and backend systems. Java features strong memory management, multi-threading, and an extensive standard library. With frameworks like Spring and Hibernate, Java remains a dominant force in software development, powering applications across various industries.</p>
